# Subdomain-Pirate

This is a very simple bash script utilizing other tools made by different publishers (Like sublist3r, assetfinder, httprobe, gowitness..and more), grouping their functionalities and formatting their output for the sole purpose of automating most webapp enumeration tasks carried in a webapp assessment while navigating the target website/s for the sake of flexibility and time saving, I'm no coder so my script may lack hygeine yet feel free to do with it as you may see fit, It's free real estate. (Atleast bash readability is required as will need to add your API tokens in the script and may debug possible destination issues of the tools you add in your Kali linux)


Usage: ./subPirate.sh <domain> (eg., targetsite.com)
  

To get help on what you need to install and where then just call the script without arguments, hope you found my methodology useful and Happy hacking!
